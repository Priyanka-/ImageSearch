ImageSearch
===========

iOS Google Image Search

This project is an exercise in 
 - writing code to fetch data(including lots of images) from the server
 - parsing JSON into data model
 - collection view UI
 - local storage
 
This project uses Google Image search API(https://developers.google.com/image-search/v1/jsondevguide) to do image search. 

I would like to acknowledge using Apache 2.0 licensed Isaac library(https://github.com/linkedin/Isaac/) to parse JSON into data models for this project.
